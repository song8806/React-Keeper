# React Keeper
I made this website using React code to create a dymanic Keeper for notes as a capstone project when I completed the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  It uses JSX, Props, Styling, Destructuring, ES6, Declarative Programming, hooks, speed operator, components, useState, Babel, import/export, map & filter, Virtual DOM, state, and container.
